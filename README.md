# ArkanoidGame-Final

In this assignment we will continue working on the Arkanoid game.

We will extend the game to support an opening Menu-screen, which will allow us to start a new game, see the current high-scores, or quit the game.
When starting a new game, we could choose either an easy or advanced game, each game type will have different levels.

We will be saving the high-scores of players across different games. This means that we will be using Java I/O to read and write files.
Another change from the previous assignment is that in this assignment, the different levels will not be hard-coded in your code,
but instead will be read from level-description files. We will also be practicing the concept of Factories -- object that create other objects.
We will also practice a bit of java generics.

Finally, in this assignment you will also create an executable jar file, that will contain your compiled code as well as the resources needed for it to run.

- Here are some pictures of od diffrent levels in the final arkanoid game.
